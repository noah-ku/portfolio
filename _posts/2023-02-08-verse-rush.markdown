Verse Rush is a project that I created in 2021. The goal of the game is to fill in randomly generated blanks for any given Bible verse.

## Overview

</p>

Players are given a few seconds to memorize the Bible verse that is projected. After the time is up, players must type in the words that belong in the blanks to keep going. Each iteration adds 5 more blanks to the verse until all the words are gone. This game is meant to be played in a classroom environment.

The settings page offers a variety of ways to change the way you play. Verses can be manually inputted and the starting time can be adjusted based on the player's needs. Additionally, to make the game more challenging, an option to force all blanks is available.
