Epicure is a project that I created in 2020. The game is currently being sold on Steam and over 60 people have purchased Epicure.

## Overview

The main objective is to make as many burgers in a day as possible and earn more money in the process. Food orders are randomly generated and players must use the 5 main ingredients (buns, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and meat) to complete these orders. Occasionally, customers will also ask for different sodas.

Another game mode that is available is The Grid. It is a 2v2 mode where two teams of two players must team up to complete a grid of orders faster than the other team. The 5x5 grid of orders is the same for all players to ensure fairness, and players must work together to complete all 25 orders as fast as possible.
